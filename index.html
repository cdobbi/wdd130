            <p>Hello! My name is Christi Dobbins.  I am from Payson, Utah.  In my life, I wear many hats: a mother, grandmother, daughter, wife, and a passionate breeder of heritage rabbits, to name a few.  Currently, I'm embarking on an educational journey with Brigham Young University-Idaho Pathways, where I'm diving into the realms of Software and Web Design and Development online.  The upcoming block promises to deepen my understanding of Python, HTML, CSS, and SQL, alongside a broader exploration of the tech world.  This learning opportunity fills me with gratitude, allowing me to stretch my intellectual muscles in ways I couldn't while focusing on family.  My husband's unwavering support in this venture means the world to me.  Filled with excitement, I eagerly look forward to discovering how this adventure will unfold for me and my family.</p>
